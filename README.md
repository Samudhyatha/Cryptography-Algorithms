This repository contains Python implementations for several cryptographic algorithms:

* Affine Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher
* Extended Euclidean Algorithm
* RSA Algorithm
* ElGamal Encryption

*Affine Cipher*

The affine cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The implementation in affine_cipher.py likely includes functions for encryption and decryption using an affine key.

*Vigenere Cipher*

The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to perform multiple Caesar ciphers on the plaintext. The implementation in vigenere_cipher.py likely includes functions for encryption and decryption using a keyword.

*Extended Euclidean Algorithm*

The extended Euclidean algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and their Bezout coefficients. The implementation in extended_euclidean.py likely includes a function to calculate the GCD and Bezout coefficients of two integers.

*RSA Algorithm*

The RSA algorithm is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large numbers. The implementation in rsa_algorithm.py likely includes functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.

*ElGamal Encryption*

ElGamal encryption is a public-key cryptosystem based on discrete logarithms. The implementation in el_gamal.py likely includes functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.
